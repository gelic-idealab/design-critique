## Open Zoom on a computer or phone 

**Using headphones connected to a mobile phone in your pocket is the recommended option.** This way, your mic will be close to your face when you speak, and you are free to move and rotate.

**Using Zoom on a computer on speakerphone is an acceptable option.** Just make sure you face the computer when you speak.

Do not connect a headphone/mic cord to your computer and wear a VR headset, because it is too easy to forget about the cord and injure yourself or damage something. 

## Set up your Quest headset

Watch these Oculus Quest Basics Tutorial videos:
