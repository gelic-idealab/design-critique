Preview your model by going to https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/ and dragging the GLB file onto the page. 

NOTE: GLB files generated with Tilt Brush need post-processing to display properly, so colors and animations may look incorrect in the preview on the link above. Also, Windows 3D Viewer cannot read Tilt Brush-generated GLB files, unfortunately.

Then make a new sketch. 

## 8. Understand the difference between sketch files and model files

Sketch files are TILT files, and save all data associated with your sketch, including the environment and image references. They are like PSD files, or Word documents. They can only be opened by Tilt Brush or custom apps built with Tilt Brush tools. If you want to edit your sketch in the future, you should keep this file. 

Model files are GLB or FBX files, and save only the brush strokes from your sketch. They are like PNG files. They can be imported into other viewer apps. If you want to just view the model made from your sketch, you should use this file.  The easiest way to turn a sketch into a model file is to use Tilt Brush, so it is best to export a model file while you are in the app. 

## 9. Troubleshooting

The browser may not automatically open when you do some of the following: 

* Try to sign into Google Poly
* Try to sign into Google Drive
* Try to view files on Google Drive

If that happens, save your sketch, relaunch Tilt Brush, and try again.
