## Learn to use Komodo

### Show the menu

1. Switch to a right-handed menu by pressing the Komodo menu button (`Y`) on your left controller.
2. Press the Komodo menu button (`B`) on your right controller to switch back to a left-handed menu.
3. Press either menu icon to show and hide the menu. 

### Use the menu

1. Point your hand at the menu.
2. Press the trigger button. 

### Reset your position

Choose "Re-center" (the house icon) in the menu. 

We recommend doing this because the starting position may have been affected by any scrolling motion done before you entered VR. 

### Calibrate your height

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Press `Calibrate Height` if you are able to stand.
3. If not, press the `+` or `-` buttons until you are at a comfortable height. 

### Look for others

Wave to your peers!

### Teleport

1. Press and hold the thumbstick like a button.
2. Aim at the floor.
3. Let go of the thumbstick. 
4. NOTE: due to a bug in fashion-v0.2.0 (core-v0.2.3), sometimes, you need to teleport twice to land at the correct height. (Do not recalibrate your height -- simply teleport a second time to the same place.) Our apologies. 

### Snap turn (rotate your view)

Quickly flick the thumbstick left or right.

### Move and rotate a model

1. Place your hand in a model.
2. Squeeze the grip button. 
3. Move your hand.
4. Let go of the grip button.

### Stretch a model

1. Place both hands in a model.
2. Squeeze both grip buttons. 
3. Move both hands.
4. Let go of both grip buttons.
