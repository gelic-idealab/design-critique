## Learn to use Komodo

### Show the menu

1. Switch to a right-handed menu by pressing the Komodo menu button (`Y`) on your left controller.
2. Press the Komodo menu button (`B`) on your right controller to switch back to a left-handed menu.
3. Press either menu icon to show and hide the menu. 

### Use the menu

1. Point your hand at the menu.
2. Press the trigger button with your index finger.

### Reset your position

Choose "Starting location" (the house icon) in the menu. 

We recommend doing this because the starting position may have been affected by any scrolling motion done before you entered VR. 

### Calibrate your height

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Press `Calibrate Height` if you are able to stand.
3. If not, press the `/\ /\` or `\/ \/` buttons until you are at a comfortable height. 

### Look for others

Wave to your peers!

### Teleport

1. Press and hold the thumbstick like a button.
2. Aim at the floor.
3. Let go of the thumbstick. 
4. NOTE: due to a bug in the latest version of Komodo, sometimes, you need to teleport twice to land at the correct height. (Do not recalibrate your height -- simply teleport a second time to the same place.) Our apologies. 

### Snap turn (rotate your view)

Quickly flick the thumbstick left or right.
