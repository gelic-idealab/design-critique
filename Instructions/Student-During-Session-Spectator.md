Note: Create (draw, erase, undo) menu tools, Height Calibration, moving models, and stretching models only work in VR and not on a desktop or laptop browser. Sorry about this.

### Use the menu

Select the People tab to check your connection state. Press Leave & Rejoin or Close Connection & Rejoin to try and reconnect first. If that still doesn't work, refresh the page.

### Move around

**Move Forward, Back, Left, Right**: <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd>

**Rotate view / change movement direction**: Click and drag

**Look left or right** -- <kbd>Q</kbd> <kbd>E</kbd>

**Look up or down** -- <kbd>2</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd>

**Reset your position** -- Select Settings, then choose "Starting Position."

**Hyperspeed motion (not recommended)** -- Scroll over the Komodo viewport

### Look for others

Others can't see your hands, but they can see your head. Nod or shake your head!
