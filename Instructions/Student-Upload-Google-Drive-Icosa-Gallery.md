Unfortunately, these are no longer supported by Google.

Icosa Gallery is working on replacements within Open Brush, but they are not ready yet.

## Understand the difference between sketch files and model files

Sketch files are TILT files, and save all data associated with your sketch, including the environment and image references. They are like PSD files, or Word documents. They can only be opened by Tilt Brush or custom apps built with Tilt Brush tools. If you want to edit your sketch in the future, you should keep this file. 

Model files are GLB or FBX files, and save only the brush strokes from your sketch. They are like PNG files. They can be imported into other viewer apps. If you want to just view the model made from your sketch, you should use this file.  The easiest way to turn a sketch into a model file is to use Tilt Brush, so it is best to export a model file while you are in the app.

The Open Brush project does not currently have documentation, but since it is a fork of Tilt Brush, you can refer to the Tilt Brush documentation.
