## Footnotes
1. Uploading files from a standalone VR headset or a mobile phone is not supported at this time.
2. This tool wraps the image around a rectangular prism. We need this step because Komodo only imports GLB files, which are 3D models. 
3. We apologize for this toggle being labeled unusually.
