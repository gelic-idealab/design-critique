## Footnotes
1. Uploading files from a standalone VR headset or a mobile phone is not supported at this time.
2. This tool wraps the image around a rectangular prism. We need this step because Komodo only imports GLB files, which are 3D models. 
3. We apologize for this toggle being labeled unusually.
4. The garment preview may look incorrect. The web viewer does not support Tilt Brush-generated GLBs. (But Komodo VR does.)
