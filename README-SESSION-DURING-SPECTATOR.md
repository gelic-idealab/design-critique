## Learn to use Komodo

Note: the Create (draw, erase, undo) feature and the Height Calibration feature only work in VR. Sorry about this.

### Use the menu

Select items with your mouse.

Press the word "Models" to collapse this panel. This panel should really only be used by the instructor, and it also blocks your view. 

Open and close panels on the left. 

Note: The menu does not use a tabbed system yet, so make sure to close a panel when you are done with it. Otherwise, the menu can get too long. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

### Move around

**Move Forward, Back, Left, Right** -- WASD or Arrow Keys

**Rotate view / change movement direction** -- Click and drag 

**Hyperspeed motion (not recommended)** -- Scroll over the Komodo window

**Reset your position** -- Press the Home icon in the upper left of the menu.

### Look for others

Others can't see your hands, but they can see your head. Nod or shake your head!
